# FileSwitcher

Sublime Text plugin. Opens corresponding js/html/css files in your project that have the same name as the current file.

Speed up frontend development by switching between html, js, and css file using keyboard shortcuts.


## Example

If you are working in a file called `todo.js`, and you want to jump to the html (or handlebars etc) file `todo.html`, use the shortcut `Command + Shift + Period`

If you are working in the file called `todo.html`, and you want to jump to the corresponding CSS file `todo.html`, use the shortcut `Command + Shift + Comma`
